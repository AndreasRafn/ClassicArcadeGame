Implementation of a cross the road style game using object oriented JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.
This site is the third project submission on the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree and first use of JavaScript in a project.

Try it live here: [https://andreasrafn.github.io/MemoryGame/](https://andreasrafn.github.io/MemoryGame/)
The live version features a 9 x 9 grid, 15 enemies and a preset enemy speed range.
